# Tetris Game
## How to Play
To play the game, follow these instructions:

1. Locate the code files.
2. Open `index.html` in your web browser.
3. Click play and use the arrow keys to move the falling Tetrimino (game piece).
4. Press the "W" or the upwards arrow key to rotate the Tetrimino.
5. Try to complete full rows to score points.
6. The game ends when the Tetriminos stack up to the top of the grid. 

## Structure
The structure follows a structured organization:
- `index.html`(153 Lines): The main HTML file.
- `styles.css`(282 Lines): CSS styles for the game interface.
- `app.js`(898 Lines): The main JavaScript file for game logic.
- `/Assets`: Any assets used in the game (e.g., audio file).

## Consistent Naming Convention
To maintain clarity and consistency in the codebase, I follow these naming conventions:

### Classes

- Class names use CapitalCamelCase (e.g., `TetrisGame`, `StartupMenu`).

### Methods and Functions

- Method and function names use lowerCamelCase (e.g., `startGame()`, `openConfiguration()`).

### Variables

- Variable names use lowerCamelCase (e.g., `mainMenuStartGameBtn`, `configureGameModeSelect`).

### IDs (HTML/CSS)

- IDs names in HTML and CSS use lowerCamelCase (e.g., `gameType`, `currentScore`).

### Classes (HTML/CSS)

- IDs and class names in HTML and CSS use kebab-case (e.g., `game-container`, `start-button`).
